# Philippine Counterterrorism 2016–2026

From Marawi to Maritime Defense: A Decade of Strategic Evolution


**Manila, Philippines** – February 12, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Over the past decade, the Philippine counterterrorism landscape has undergone a fundamental transformation—from containing kinetic insurgency to managing hybrid, networked, and digitally influenced threats. This report, based on comprehensive analysis of Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) operations, Congressional Research Service assessments, and independent security research, examines critical lessons learned and identifies structural imperatives for the next phase of national security.

**Key Finding:** While large-scale territorial ambitions of terrorist organizations have been decisively defeated, adaptive decentralized threats persist, demanding an evolutionary shift from reactive suppression to anticipatory intelligence architecture.

## I. STRATEGIC CONTEXT: THE TRANSFORMATION OF EXTREMISM

### The Numbers Tell the Story

The Philippine Armed Forces has achieved measurable success in degrading organized terrorist capability:

- **Local Terrorist Group (LTG) manpower**: Reduced from 1,257 fighters in 2016 to just 50 in 2025—a 96% reduction over nine years
- **2025 Operations**: 275 LTG members neutralized, over 300 firearms recovered
- **Communist Terrorist Group (CTG) operations**: Over 2,000 members neutralized and 1,500+ firearms seized in 2025 alone
- **High-value targets**: 28 high-value individuals neutralized, including 10 key leaders, creating critical leadership gaps
- **Large-scale attacks**: Zero large-scale attacks attributed to domestic terrorist groups reported in 2025

### Abu Sayyaf Group: From Peak Threat to Organizational Collapse

The Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States in 1997, experienced systematic dismantlement:

- **September 2023**: Sulu province declared free of ASG following surrender of 966 members
- **December 2024**: Basilan province declared ASG-free after last remaining members surrendered
- **March 2024**: AFP Western Mindanao Command announced ASG had been "fully dismantled"
- **Peak to present**: From 1,250 fighters in 2000 to approximately 20 members by April 2023

### Bangsamoro Peace Process: A Counter-Narrative to Violence

The establishment of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) in 2019 created unprecedented conditions for demobilization:

- **26,132 fighters** from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front's (MILF) armed wing decommissioned as of May 2023
- **13,868 additional combatants** slated for demobilization in 2025
- **1,866 fighters** from Dawlah Islamiyah-Sulu and Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) surrendered between 2018-2023

## II. THE MARAWI CRUCIBLE: LESSONS FROM THE PHILIPPINES' LONGEST BATTLE

### Strategic Intelligence Failure and Tactical Adaptation

The five-month Siege of Marawi (May 23–October 23, 2017) exposed critical vulnerabilities while demonstrating operational resilience:

**The Intelligence Gap:**
- Philippine forces expected to engage approximately 100 fighters
- Actual combatant strength: 900-1,000 ISIS-affiliated militants
- The miscalculation reflected systemic failures in cross-agency intelligence fusion

**Human Cost:**
- **Government forces**: 168 military casualties
- **Militants**: Over 950 killed
- **Civilians**: Estimates range from 47-87 killed (remarkably low for urban warfare of this scale)
- **Displaced persons**: 360,000 internally displaced persons (55% children, 52% female)

**Physical Destruction:**
- **3,125 buildings** completely destroyed
- **913 buildings** suffered major damage
- **1,232 buildings** suffered minor damage
- **95% of structures** in eastern Marawi experienced battle damage

*Sources: Modern War Institute at West Point (May 2024); Australian Strategic Policy Institute (April 2025); Amnesty International; Asian Development Bank Emergency Assistance Report*

### The Economic Toll

The Asian Development Bank's Post-Conflict Needs Assessment calculated total recovery requirements:

- **$969 million (₱51.7 billion)** required for full rehabilitation
- **Economic contraction**: Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) GRDP contracted by 6.3% in 2017
- **Private sector losses**: $124 million (₱6.631 billion)

**Reconstruction Reality Check:**
- As of 2020 (3 years post-conflict): 120,000 residents remained displaced
- As of 2023 (6 years post-conflict): Less than 1% of 17,793 displaced households had homes rebuilt
- Government disbursed only ₱22.2 billion ($457 million) by 2020—described by monitoring groups as a "dismal amount"

### Tactical Innovation: The Tear Gas Success Story

Unlike Western militaries bound by chemical weapons restrictions in warfare, the AFP's use of tear gas provided a critical non-lethal option:

**Operational Benefits:**
- Forced enemy withdrawal without lethal force
- Minimized civilian casualties
- Reduced structural damage (avoiding rubble warfare)
- Protected friendly force lives

**Strategic Implication:** The battle demonstrated that without effective non-lethal alternatives, even highly trained militaries face binary choices: protracted urban combat or overwhelming firepower with catastrophic humanitarian consequences.

## III. STRUCTURAL LESSONS: WHY TACTICAL SUCCESS DOESN'T GUARANTEE STRATEGIC VICTORY

### Lesson 1: Tactical Excellence ≠ Strategic Intelligence Fusion

The AFP's special operations units have proven highly capable in kinetic engagements. However, persistent institutional challenges remain:

**Identified Gaps:**
- Data silos between Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine National Police (PNP), and civilian intelligence agencies
- Limited centralized risk modeling infrastructure
- Heavy dependence on human intelligence (HUMINT) over signals intelligence (SIGINT) and pattern analysis
- Insufficient real-time analytics and cross-agency interoperability

**Critical Insight:** Future threats will not announce themselves kinetically. They will emerge as pattern anomalies detectable only through integrated intelligence architecture.

### Lesson 2: Terror Networks Operate as Adaptive Systems

Decade-long observation reveals consistent adaptation patterns:

**When territorial control fails** → Groups decentralize into micro-cells

**When leadership is neutralized** → Recruitment migrates to digital platforms

**When financing channels close** → Informal alternative routes emerge (maritime smuggling, kidnap-for-ransom, clan-based fundraising)

**Strategic Implication:** Counterterrorism must evolve from reactive suppression to anticipatory modeling that accounts for organizational plasticity.

### Lesson 3: The Philippines' Archipelagic Geography Is Structural, Not Incidental

The archipelago creates persistent vulnerabilities:

- **7,641 islands** spanning 1,850 kilometers
- **Complex maritime boundaries** across Sulu Sea, Celebes Sea, and West Philippine Sea
- **Porous borders** enabling informal cross-border movement
- **Monitoring challenges** across vast maritime spaces

**2023-2025 Maritime Response:**
The AFP conducted 820 maritime and air patrols in the West Philippine Sea in 2023 alone, demonstrating that maritime domain awareness has become a strategic imperative—not an auxiliary capability.

*Source: Armed Forces of the Philippines (2023 Year-End Report)*

### Lesson 4: The Intelligence Gap Is Integration, Not Volume

**The Paradox:** Signals existed before major escalations. The consistent vulnerability is not lack of raw intelligence—it's the failure to synthesize disparate data streams into actionable threat assessments.

**Required Capabilities:**
- Cross-agency data interoperability platforms
- Real-time analytics infrastructure
- Identity resolution systems
- Graph-based network analysis
- Pattern recognition algorithms (with human oversight)

## IV. CURRENT THREAT ASSESSMENT: THE EVOLUTION CONTINUES

### ISIS-East Asia: Fragmented but Not Eliminated

Despite organizational degradation, ISIS-aligned elements persist:

**Leadership Losses:**
- **June 2023**: Faharudin Hadji Satar (Abu Zacharia), ISIS-East Asia emir, killed in Marawi
- **April 2024**: Mohiden Alimodin Animbang (Kagui Karialan), BIFF-Karialan leader, killed alongside 11 followers

**Continuing Activity:**
- **2023**: ISIS claimed credit for approximately 20 small-scale attacks targeting police/military in Lanao and Central Mindanao
- **December 2023**: Mindanao State University bombing (ISIS claimed responsibility)
- **January-March 2025**: 57 BIFF members surrendered

*Sources: National Counterterrorism Center; The Soufan Center (May 2025); Philippines Security Report (April 2024); U.S. Institute of Peace (April 2024)*

### The Remnant Threat: Small, Fragmented, Still Dangerous

**Active Groups (2024-2025):**
- Dawlah Islamiyah (DI) factions in Lanao del Sur
- Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) remnants in Maguindanao
- Islamic State-Sulu and Islamic State-Basilan cells
- Daulah Islamiyah Maute Group (described as "potent jihadist threat" by The Soufan Center)

**Key Characteristic:** No single unified ISIS-East Asia leadership structure exists. Instead, loosely connected groups operate in geographic silos with local ethnic recruitment bases.

**Strategic Concern:** The December 2023 Mindanao State University attack—targeting a campus that remained unbreached during the 2017 Marawi siege—demonstrates intent to reignite conflict and inspire violent resurgence during the sensitive pre-election period.

## V. PREDICTIVE INTELLIGENCE: THREE EMERGING THREAT VECTORS

### Vector 1: Micro-Cell Radicalization

**Expected Characteristics:**
- Smaller autonomous cells (3-7 individuals)
- Minimal physical training requirements
- Digitally inspired actors consuming ISIS propaganda
- Reduced large-scale territorial attempts

**Detection Requirements:**
- Social graph anomaly modeling
- Online narrative tracking across encrypted platforms
- Financial micro-transaction pattern analysis
- Behavioral clustering algorithms

### Vector 2: Criminal-Extremist Convergence

Economic instability and regional fragmentation are blurring traditional boundaries:

**Hybrid Threat Profile:**
- Organized crime networks adopting extremist branding for intimidation
- Kidnap-for-ransom operations funding ideological activity
- Maritime piracy with extremist elements

**Historical Precedent:** Abu Sayyaf Group's evolution from ideological terrorism to profit-driven kidnapping demonstrates this convergence pattern.

**Monitoring Imperative:** Financial flow analysis and maritime anomaly detection become critical early-warning mechanisms.

### Vector 3: Signal Intelligence Evolution

**Traditional SIGINT Limitations:**
- Communication interception (vulnerable to encryption)
- Metadata tracking (requires advanced technical capability)

**Next-Generation Requirements:**
- Behavioral pattern modeling across multiple data streams
- Risk scoring systems with transparent methodology
- AI-assisted anomaly detection (human oversight mandatory)
- Network topology analysis (identifying central nodes)

**Critical Distinction:** Predictive intelligence is not prediction of guilt. It is early identification of risk clusters requiring further investigation.

## VI. INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COOPERATION: A FORCE MULTIPLIER

### U.S.-Philippines Defense Partnership

**2024-2025 Engagement:**
- **Exercise Balikatan 2024**: Over 16,000 U.S. and AFP soldiers participated (plus Australian, French, Japanese contingents)
- **Exercise Balikatan 2025**: Over 14,000 participants with Australian and Japanese forces
- **First-time milestone**: Maritime drills conducted outside territorial waters in Philippines' 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone

**U.S. Military Assistance:**
- **July 2024**: Biden Administration pledged $500 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) from Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental Appropriations Act
- **FY2023**: $169.5 million in U.S. assistance (military aid, rule of law, health, education, environmental programs)
- **Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)**: Provides U.S. access to Philippine bases for rotational deployments

*Sources: Congressional Research Service Reports IF10250 (multiple editions); U.S. Department of State*

### Multilateral Maritime Cooperation

**2025 Operations:**
- **6 Maritime Cooperative Activities** with individual partners
- **7 Multilateral Maritime Cooperative Activities** involving U.S., Japan, India, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand

**Strategic Rationale:** As AFP shifts focus from internal security to territorial defense (particularly West Philippine Sea tensions with China), maritime interoperability becomes essential.

### Regional Counterterrorism Architecture

**Philippine Memberships:**
- UN Counter-Terrorism mechanisms
- ASEAN security cooperation frameworks
- Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) counterterrorism working groups
- Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS
- Counter-ISIS Finance and Communications Working Groups

## VII. INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS: BUILDING ADAPTIVE CAPACITY

### 2025 Organizational Restructuring

The AFP implemented major structural reforms to support multi-domain operations:

**September 2025: AFP Joint Sustainment Command**
- Purpose: Unify logistics and support functions across services

**October 2025: AFP Strategic Command**
- Purpose: Integrate intelligence and operations planning

**November 2025: AFP Civil-Military Operations Command**
- Purpose: Enhance strategic communication and community engagement
- Note: Replaced Civil Relations Service Armed Forces of the Philippines (CRSAFP)

**May 2025: Joint Special Operations Command**
- Purpose: Unify special operations forces under single command structure

**February 2025: National Capital Region Command (Reactivated)**
- Purpose: Improve internal security and crisis response in Metro Manila

*Source: Armed Forces of the Philippines (December 2025 statement)*

### Modernization Acquisitions

**2025 Capability Enhancements:**

**Air Assets:**
- SF-260 training aircraft (September 2025)
- 10 additional S-70 Black Hawk helicopters (5 in August, 5 in November)

**Naval Assets:**
- BRP Miguel Malvar (FFG-06) guided-missile frigate
- BRP Diego Silang (FFG-07) guided-missile frigate
- Locally assembled fast-attack interdiction craft

**Missile Systems:**
- Announced intention to purchase U.S. Typhon missile system (provoking Chinese warnings of regional "arms race")
- Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) deployed in Luzon Strait exercises

## VIII. THE PREVENTION ARCHITECTURE: BEYOND KINETIC OPERATIONS

### Program Against Violent Extremism (PAVE)

Following the death of Abu Sayyaf emir Isnilon Hapilon during Marawi recapture, the Philippine government launched comprehensive reintegration programming:

**PAVE Components:**
- Psychological counseling
- Housing assistance
- Vocational training
- Food security support
- Family reintegration services

**Documented Impact:**
- **First two years**: Over 200 Abu Sayyaf members surrendered
- **First batch**: 139 defectors
- **IPAC Assessment**: PAVE likely prevented a resurgence of ASG violence

*Source: Institute for the Policy Analysis of Conflict; The Soufan Center (March 2025)*

### National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism

**Multi-Stakeholder Approach:**
- Local government units leading community-specific programs
- Civil society organizations providing grassroots monitoring
- Private sector partnerships on economic opportunities
- Religious leaders countering extremist narratives

**Localized Strategy Rationale:** Different localities respond to different incentives. National-level programs lack granular understanding of clan dynamics, economic grievances, and social networks.

**Critical Insight from Indonesia-Philippines Comparative Analysis:**
"The greatest gains come from investments in local institutions: the family, the mosque, or the neighborhood. Directing funds to a wife to pay for children's school fees can build rapport with a prisoner. Disrupting pro-ISIS study sessions in a mosque can end, or at least reduce, ISIS recruitment at that venue."

### Surrenderee Motivation Research

Academic research by Najwa Indanan Unga identified key factors driving demobilization:

**Primary Reasons for Surrender:**
- Physical exhaustion and starvation
- Burnout from sustained operations
- Loss of public support
- Family pressure
- Disillusionment with group tactics and leadership
- Desire to return to normal life
- **BIFF-specific**: Changing political context with BARMM autonomy reducing need for armed struggle

**Policy Implication:** Effective disengagement programming must address both "push factors" (making militancy untenable) and "pull factors" (making civilian reintegration attractive).

## IX. STRATEGIC INFLECTION POINT: 2025 BARMM ELECTIONS

### The Fragile Peace

The May 2025 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region parliamentary elections represent a critical juncture:

**Best Case Scenario:**
- Successful democratic transition consolidates peace process
- Continued demobilization of remaining combatants
- Economic development reduces extremist recruitment pool

**Worst Case Scenario:**
- Electoral violence or disputed results undermine BARMM legitimacy
- Pro-ISIS spoilers successfully disrupt peace process
- Resumption of conflict forces AFP to redeploy from territorial defense to internal security

**Cascading Strategic Consequences:**
If Bangsamoro peace fails, Manila would be forced to:
- Abandon repositioning of armed forces toward external defense
- Reduce focus on West Philippine Sea territorial disputes
- Compromise security partnerships with U.S., Japan, Australia
- Sacrifice maritime domain awareness investments

## X. THE NEXT DECADE: FROM REACTIVE TO PREDICTIVE

### The Architecture of Anticipatory Intelligence

Future counterterrorism effectiveness depends on six foundational capabilities:

#### 1. Unified Data Fusion Platforms
- Integration of AFP, PNP, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), civilian databases
- Real-time data sharing protocols
- Common operating picture accessible across agencies

#### 2. Graph-Based Network Analysis
- Social network mapping of extremist connections
- Identification of central nodes and influence pathways
- Dynamic updating as networks evolve

#### 3. Transparent Risk Scoring Models
- Algorithmic threat assessment with documented methodology
- Regular auditing for bias and accuracy
- Public oversight mechanisms

#### 4. Embedded Civil Liberty Guardrails
- Legal framework defining permissible data collection
- Judicial review of surveillance activities
- Citizen privacy protections

#### 5. Maritime Anomaly Analytics
- Automated Identification System (AIS) pattern analysis
- Vessel tracking across porous maritime boundaries
- Integration with regional maritime security networks

#### 6. Financial Flow Pattern Detection
- Micro-transaction monitoring for terrorist financing indicators
- Informal value transfer system (hawala) tracking
- Cross-border financial intelligence sharing

### Technology + Human Judgment

**Critical Principle:** Technology alone will not solve terrorism. Structured intelligence systems reduce blind spots, but human analysis remains essential for:
- Contextual interpretation
- Ethical oversight
- Strategic decision-making
- Community engagement

---

## XI. COMPARATIVE REGIONAL CONTEXT

### Southeast Asia Terrorism Trends

**Indonesia:**
- Jemaah Islamiyah declared disbandment June 30, 2024
- Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) remains active threat with recent disrupted plots

**Malaysia:**
- May 2024 attack on police post in Ulu Tiram, Johor State by ISIS sympathizer
- Heightened vigilance against transnational extremist networks

**Regional Lesson:** Even as major terrorist organizations disband or decline, remnant cells and quasi-independent actors retain attack capability. Sustained vigilance and regional cooperation remain imperative.

## XII. CONCLUSION: OPERATIONAL COURAGE MEETS ANALYTICAL ARCHITECTURE

### What the Decade Has Proven

**Tactical Achievements:**
- Large-scale insurgent territorial branding can be decisively defeated
- Leadership decapitation works as tactical disruption
- Legal frameworks can expand state authority when needed
- Multilateral security cooperation enhances operational effectiveness

**Persistent Challenges:**
- Adaptive, decentralized threats remain viable
- Reconstruction and rehabilitation lag behind military success
- Intelligence integration deficits persist across agencies
- Maritime geography creates structural vulnerabilities

### The Defining Question for 2026–2036

The next decade will not be defined by another Marawi-scale territorial seizure.

It will be defined by a single question:

**Will Philippine intelligence systems evolve from reactive to predictive?**

### Predictive ≠ Intrusive

Predictive intelligence is not:
- Mass surveillance without oversight
- Algorithmic guilt determination
- Erosion of civil liberties

Predictive intelligence is:
- Early identification of risk patterns
- Integrated multi-source analysis
- Transparent methodology with legal safeguards
- Human oversight of technological systems

### The Next Frontier

The Philippines has demonstrated operational courage through:
- The Marawi siege recapture
- Sustained counterterrorism operations
- Leadership neutralization campaigns
- Comprehensive demobilization programs

**The next frontier is analytical architecture:**
- Data fusion infrastructure
- Pattern recognition capability
- Anticipatory threat modeling
- Civil liberty-embedded intelligence systems

### Final Assessment

Technology will not solve terrorism.

But integrated, transparent, legally constrained intelligence architecture reduces catastrophic blind spots.

The Philippines stands at an inflection point where past tactical success can be consolidated into strategic resilience—or where fragmented systems allow adaptive threats to mutate beyond institutional response capacity.

The choice between these futures is being made today.
