## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fundamentally transformed defense and intelligence operations globally. In 2025, leading nations deploy AI-powered systems for threat prediction, counterterrorism, surveillance, and strategic decision-making. This report examines the current state of AI implementation in defense agencies worldwide and presents a comprehensive, actionable framework for the Philippine defense sector.

Global intelligence agencies have demonstrated that AI increases threat detection accuracy by up to 94.5%, reduces incident response times by over 90%, and enables the processing of petabytes of data that would be impossible for human analysts alone. The United States, United Kingdom, Israel, and other advanced nations have invested billions in AI-driven defense capabilities, establishing dedicated organizational structures and ethical frameworks to govern their deployment.

The Philippines stands at a critical juncture. With the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) targeting an AI-powered nation by 2028 through the National AI Strategy, and the country improving from 61st to 53rd in the UN Global Cybersecurity Index, we have momentum. However, defense-specific AI implementation remains nascent compared to peer nations in ASEAN and globally.

This report provides a plug-and-play framework that Philippine defense agencies can implement immediately. The framework addresses five critical dimensions: technical infrastructure, workforce development, operational integration, ethical governance, and international cooperation. Each component includes specific requirements, implementation steps, and success metrics tailored to Philippine context and constraints.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background and Context

The threat landscape facing nations in 2025 is fundamentally different from any previous era. Terrorism has evolved from centralized organizations like Al-Qaeda to decentralized networks and lone actors radicalized online. Extremist groups such as the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) leverage generative AI to produce propaganda in 13 languages simultaneously, creating polished videos and synthetic voice clips that rival professional journalism. The Philippines faces its own unique challenges with Abu Sayyaf, communist insurgency, and transnational threats that require sophisticated intelligence capabilities.

The volume of intelligence data has grown exponentially. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) transports more data globally than any other U.S. agency. Intelligence communities worldwide face a fundamental constraint: not scarcity of information but abundance. The human analyst has become the limiting factor when processing surveillance footage, communications intercepts, social media posts, and open-source intelligence. This data deluge demands AI-powered solutions.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research aims to:

- Analyze how leading nations deploy AI for counterterrorism and threat detection
- Identify specific AI technologies and their defense applications
- Assess the Philippines' current AI readiness in defense sectors
- Develop an implementation framework adaptable to Philippine defense agencies
- Define requirements, resources, and implementation steps
- Establish ethical guidelines and governance structures

### 1.3 Methodology

This research synthesizes publicly available defense strategies, academic literature, and recent developments in AI-powered defense systems from 2024-2025. Primary sources include the U.S. Department of Defense AI strategy, UK Ministry of Defence AI framework, Israeli defense AI initiatives, and Philippine national AI strategies. The framework development draws from operational best practices, technical requirements documented in military AI implementations, and international governance standards including the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of AI.

The Philippines has a unique opportunity to leapfrog traditional development pathways. We need not replicate the decades-long evolution of Western defense establishments. With the right strategy, partnerships, and investments, we can build modern, AI-powered defense capabilities that reflect Filipino values and address our specific security challenges.

This framework provides a clear path forward. It is comprehensive yet flexible, ambitious yet realistic, technologically advanced yet ethically grounded. Success requires sustained commitment from leadership, adequate resource allocation, and most importantly, a shared vision among all defense agencies.

The threats we face—terrorism, insurgency, cyber attacks, maritime incursions—are evolving rapidly. Our defensive capabilities must evolve faster. AI is not a silver bullet, but it is an essential force multiplier that enables our analysts, operators, and decision-makers to work smarter, faster, and more effectively.

The time to act is now. As we approach 2028—the target year for both DOST's national AI strategy and this defense framework—we have a narrow window to establish the foundations that will protect the Philippines for decades to come. With unity of effort and proper execution, we can transform our defense posture from reactive to predictive, from resource-constrained to AI-augmented, from vulnerable to resilient.

**The future of Philippine national security depends on decisions made today. This framework provides the blueprint. The rest depends on our collective will to implement it.**
